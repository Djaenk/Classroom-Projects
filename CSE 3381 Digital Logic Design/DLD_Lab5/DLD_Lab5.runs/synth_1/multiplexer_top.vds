Finished Parsing XDC File [U:/DLD_Lab5/DLD_Lab5.srcs/constrs_1/imports/Downloads/Basys3_Master.xdc]
INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [U:/DLD_Lab5/DLD_Lab5.srcs/constrs_1/imports/Downloads/Basys3_Master.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/multiplexer_top_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/multiplexer_top_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.
