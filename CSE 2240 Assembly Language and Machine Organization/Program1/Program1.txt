*CSE 2240 PROGRAM 1*

*DUE: Monday, February 18 @ 11:59 PM*

 

Write an ARM assembly program that will evaluate the following
expression, placing the result in register 0:

 

r0 = ((-C + D) * (F - E)^2 )^  / 16

 

Your program must use the following data definitions:

 

C       DCD     234

D       DCD     401

E       DCD     9

F       DCD      100

 

You will need to use the LDR instruction to load C, D, E and F into
registers.  You will need to use LSR to simulate division by 16. Use a
hexadecimal calculator to verify that your result is correct. Be sure to
comment your program well.  Submit your .s file (that is the file
containing your source code) through Canvas.
